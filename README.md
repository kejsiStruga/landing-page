# HTML5 & Bootstrap Responsive Design

1. Downloaded the files from the Bootstrap site, always a good practice to avoid CDNs, Components and layout options to get an understanding
2. Added the custom styling to the default Bootstrap navigation bar
3. Created the Splash Screen for the user when he enters the screen 
4. Adjusted the background image to fit, no matter what the background size is being used
5. Changed the font of entire page, also used the font-awesome icons by donwloading the relevant style sheet and linking it to the index file 
6. Consistently styled the buttons throughout the page 
7. Created the social icons using font-awesome + added the hover state 
8. Added the *About Us* section which is split in two sections one of which contains an image and the other displays text
9. Added the *Latest Work* section with the new **card** feature in Bootstrap 4
10. Added **overlay** and applied styles and positioning to ensure the hover image is correctly positioned 
11. Added the *Why Work With Us* section for potential clients + added the font-awesome icons
12. Added the famous Bootstrap carousel at the end of the page, but in this case we used it for customer reviews or testimonials which is relatively unique way to show a common feature on a page 
13. Added the *Pricing* section which used to be a bit hard to built previously given that there were no out-of-the-box patterns for it, but again here I used the Card feature presented in Bootstrap 4
14. Added the *Contact Us* section 
15. Added the *Footer* section, which of course is a bit darker than the rest of the screen 
16. Media-queries which ensure un that the screen in appropriately presented in all devices, are incorporated in the style.css file, where all the rest of the styles are added as well 
17. This Web-Page was tested on various devices as per specification 
18. Used *Animate.css* and the *Wow.js* for the fade-in effect of the header
